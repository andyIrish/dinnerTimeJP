1. github?? make public rep
2. input from UI and store it as 
3. singly linked arryalist for Data Structure

add, print, double if more ingedients,

search for all ingredients - pulls first

if you have extra items here are other recipes 

fill array of ingedients - dialogue box java GUI 


object.time 

compare two lists - array list is recipe objects - arraylist of objects housing ingredients 


GUI -- davis - Key Ingredient  - only inputs are ingredients and time  - USERINPUT no spaces, one word, one at a time 
Database - jaydyn - newArrayList for cooking time and KEYINGREDIENTS 
Search - userInput will be by Time
Sort -  by time - 1 parameter vy time - would bring you to Printing out recipes within those servings 

TIme and Servings

arraylist is data structure 

could the output of sort be if (keyingredient == userInput)
{
	
}
Another sorting idea...
Use items entered in UI (an "on hand" listto create a metric to return a few recipes that most closely match "on hand" list. suggesting missing items for purchase. A simple count of matches might suffice.
